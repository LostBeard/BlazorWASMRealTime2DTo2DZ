In this demo, each webcam video frame is converted to 2D+Z using 
[SpawnDev.BlazorJS.TransformersJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.TransformersJS) and 
[TransformStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream).

## TransformStream
The TransformStream interface of the Streams API represents a concrete implementation of the pipe chain transform stream concept.

## SpawnDev.BlazorJS.TransformersJS
This library wraps the awesome [Transformers.js](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/) library, 
which is a JavaScript library for running machine learning models in the browser. It provides a set of pre-trained 
models that can be used for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and more.
